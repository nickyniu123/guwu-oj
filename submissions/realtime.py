"""Real-time submission status push over Redis pub/sub.

Judge workers (RQ, usually on separate judge hosts) publish lightweight
"submission changed" notifications on the Redis instance they share with
their RQ queue. The web-side ASGI WebSocket service subscribes to every
enabled judge Redis (pub/sub is instance-wide, not database-scoped) plus
the local cache Redis (for web-originated saves) and turns notifications
into database snapshots pushed to the watching browsers.

The JSON payload shape is shared verbatim with the long-polling HTTP API
(``submission_status_api``) so the frontend renders both identically and
can fall back from WebSocket to polling without any glue code.
