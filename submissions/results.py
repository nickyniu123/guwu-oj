"""Web-side persistence of judge outcomes (Phase 3).

The result-queue consumer is the ONLY writer path in the DB-less design:
judge workers never hold PostgreSQL credentials. Everything here is
idempotent and fencing-protected:

* the terminal verdict, the case-result replacement and the Accepted
  side effects happen in ONE transaction gated by the claim token, so a
  crashed consumer redelivers a clean full write instead of a partial one,
  and a stale worker's late envelope affects zero rows;
* per-case ``partial`` envelopes only feed the live view: they are written
  one row at a time under the same fence, so they can neither block the
  terminal write nor overwrite a verdict that already landed;
* rewards are intrinsically idempotent (M2M add + point ledger keyed on
  (user, event_type, event_key));
* infra failures are re-enqueued a bounded number of times (Redis
  counter) before being fenced as FAILED/System Error.
