"""Celery worker lifecycle hooks for judge machines.

When a Celery worker process becomes ready it warms the per-language judge
container pool and starts writing ``judge:worker:*`` heartbeat keys onto the
central broker for the web-side fleet health check
(``judge_health.check_central_worker_heartbeat``). Shutdown stops the
heartbeat and drains the pool.
